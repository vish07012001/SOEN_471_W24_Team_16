# SOEN_471_W24_Team_16

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of vulnerability detection in source code through the utilization of machine learning algorithms. Collaborating with a small company specializing in source code vulnerability detection, our team focuses on leveraging static code analysis reports generated by the company.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises reports generated by the static code analysis tools, encompassing various features crucial for vulnerability assessment. These features include:
- Severity Levels: Indicating the severity of detected vulnerabilities.
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Identifiers: Identifying common types of software weaknesses.
- Type of Errors/Vulnerabilities: Enumerating specific types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Missing '()' invoking constructor, Command Injection).
- Tools Used: Detailing the static code analysis tools employed (e.g., JSHint, ESLint, PMD).
- Location Details: Providing file path and line numbers where vulnerabilities are detected.
- Status Indicators: Classifying vulnerabilities as "escalated" or "false positive".

## Research Questions
- Optimal Model Selection: Which machine learning algorithms are most effective for vulnerability detection in source code, given static code analysis reports? How do different machine learning algorithms perform in terms of accuracy and efficiency?
- Integration Challenges: What are the key challenges in integrating machine learning models into the existing vulnerability detection framework?

## Model Design

### Machine Learning Algorithms
To address the research questions, we plan to implement and compare the following machine learning algorithms:
- Decision Tree: Decision Tree is chosen for its interpretability and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data effectively. It provides a clear representation of decision-making processes, which can aid in understanding the underlying logic behind vulnerability detection. 
- Random Forest: Random Forest is selected as an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It offers improved robustness and accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees' predictions. This ensemble approach helps mitigate the risk of overfitting associated with individual decision trees and generally results in better generalization performance.
  
### Model Training and Evaluation
We will conduct model training using the provided dataset and evaluate the performance of each algorithm through rigorous testing and cross-validation techniques. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be utilized to assess model effectiveness.

## Project Goals
The primary focus of our project is to develop and refine the specified machine learning algorithm. Should time permit, we will also dedicate efforts towards improving the user interface functionalities

## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning algorithms and collaborating closely with the company, we aim to significantly enhance the efficacy and scalability of source code vulnerability detection, thereby fortifying software security and mitigating potential risks effectively.
